### Debugging the application

This application uses [byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug) for
debugging. A breakpoint can be inserted by inserting a line of
`byebug` into the ruby code.

As this application is run via foreman it is not easy to interact with the
debugger via the running processes. Instead the debugger should be accessed
by creating a remote debugging session with byebug and listening. This can be
done by running the following in a separate terminal window:

```
bundle exec byebug -R localhost:3237
```

which will listen for the web application. Substitute port 3237 for 3238 to
listen to the sidekiq processes.

### Permissions

To enable development permissions (`debug` and `pre_release_features`) in a development environment run:

```
bundle exec rake development_permissions
```

To enable them for your GOV.UK account add them to your account in
[signon](https://github.com/alphagov/signon).
