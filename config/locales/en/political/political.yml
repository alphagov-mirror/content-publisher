      title: Change the history mode tag for ‘%{title}’
      body_govspeak: |
        Only a managing editor can change the political status of a page. You do not have permission to do this.

        If you think the history mode tag of this content is wrong, you need to ask the managing editor for your organisation.

        Read the [guidance about content from previous governments](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/gov-uk-content-retention-and-withdrawal-archiving-policy){:target="_blank"} (link opens in a new window).
